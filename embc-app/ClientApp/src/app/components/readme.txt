This components folder is reserved for components that are only viewable by the logged in roles but are potentially shared between all of them.
For example: A volunteer maker shouldn't be available to a generic user but it needs to be available to both the provincial admin and the local authority.
If we decide to split the components into components that differ for each role then those components go inside the components folder associated with the role they are specified for.

In the case that the component is shared by all users regardless of whether they are logged in or out, then it should go into the shared components folder.
